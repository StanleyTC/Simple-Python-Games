# Simple Python Games

Hello, welcome! this repertoire will have some simple games to strengthen concepts used in Python, such as lists, functions, 
file reading, string manipulation and repetition cycles. 
For all these concepts, two simple games are ideal for this, which 
will be listed below.

### Developed Games:
* **Guessing Game**
* **Hangman Game**

## Guessing Game
<p>the guessing game consists of the user having to guess a number that the machine is "thinking". for that, we will import libraries, in this case the random library, which, with the randint function, the machine will be able to think of a random number within a range that we choose, in this case we will choose from 0 to 10. we will also use the time library and the sleep function, to make the answers not so immediate and the game to be more natural.
The objective of the game is to make use of different libraries, library functions, use of repetition loops, in the case of while loop, and conditional structures.</p>
<p>The game is in Guessing Game (folder), only one file was needed for this file (guessing game.py) </p>

## Hangman Game
<p>The hangman game was developed using more advanced concepts. As you can imagine, the objective of the game is for the user to try to guess what the secret word is, being able to dictate one letter at a time, and each time he makes a mistake, the more the man ends up hanging himself, when he ends up totally hanging, with 6 errors, the user loses.
For this, we take random words from the internet and save them in a text file worlds.txt, and we will read this text file inside the code, in addition to making use of lists, list manipulation, string manipulation, boolean types and structures repetition and conditionals.</p>
<p>The game is in Hangman Game (folder), we needed the main file, hangman.py, and the text file, words.txt </p>
